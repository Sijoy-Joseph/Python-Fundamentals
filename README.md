Exercise 1: Print Your Name, Student Number, and Email Address
This exercise asks you to write a Python program that prints out your name, student number, and email address in the format given in the example.
The goal is to output this information directly without any extra formatting or calculations.
Exercise 2: Print Your Name, Student Number, and Email Using Escape Sequences
This task is similar to Exercise 1, but it requires the use of escape sequences (like \n for a new line or \t for a tab) to format the output in some way.
You’ll still be printing your name, student number, and email, but you’ll need to use escape characters to control the spacing or formatting.
Exercise 3: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide Two Numbers
This exercise requires you to write a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.
You'll be given the numbers 14 and 7, and you need to output the result of each operation, including the appropriate mathematical symbol for each operation.
Exercise 4: Display Numbers 1 to 5 as Steps
You need to print the numbers 1 to 5, one after the other.
The output should look like a simple list of numbers, and they should be displayed on the same line, separated by spaces.
Exercise 5: Output a Sentence with Quotation Marks and a Line Break
In this exercise, you need to print a sentence that includes quotation marks around specific words.
The sentence also needs to include a line break, meaning the text should be printed on multiple lines where necessary. The sentence is about the definitions of SDK and IDE.
Exercise 6: Practice Escape Sequences and Check Output
This exercise asks you to print various examples of Python's escape sequences. These sequences control how text appears when printed.
You’ll experiment with things like escaping quotes, printing newlines (\n), adding tabs (\t), and using special characters like \x65 (which represents a character in hexadecimal).
Exercise 7: Work with Different Variable Types and Their Sum
You are given three variables: num (an integer), textnum (a string), and decimal (a floating-point number).
First, print the type of each variable (whether it’s an integer, string, or float).
Then, calculate the sum of these variables, converting them to the same type where necessary (for example, converting the string to an integer) and find out what type the sum is.
Exercise 8: Calculate the Number of Minutes in a Year
In this exercise, you are to calculate the total number of minutes in a year.
You’ll need to use variables for days in a year, hours in a day, and minutes in an hour, and then multiply them together to get the total minutes in a year.
Finally, print out a statement that explains what your code is doing.
Exercise 9: Ask for User’s Name and Print a Greeting
This exercise involves getting input from the user. You will prompt the user to enter their name.
Once the user enters their name, your program should print a greeting using that name, such as "Hi [name], welcome to Python programming :)".
Exercise 10: Convert Pounds to Dollars
In this exercise, you write a program that converts pounds (£) into dollars ($).
The user will input an amount in pounds, and the program will output the equivalent amount in dollars using a conversion rate.
You need to print a message like: "[pounds] are $[dollars]", where [pounds] is the amount entered by the user and [dollars] is the converted amount.
